## java-lab1: "Vector calculator"
  * Needs to create GUI and some calculations.
    
## java-lab2: "Classes and Objects"
  * Needs to create GUI, to create hierarchy of inheritance by the UML diagrams.

## java-lab3: "Packages"
  * Needs to divide java-lab2 into different packages by logical explanation. Needs to add new features.

## java–lab4: "Multithreading and synchronization"
  * Needs to create some threads and synchronize them. 
  
  ## scala–lab5: "Recursion and tail recursion"
  * Needs to write functions and UI: 
  1) of computing how many symbol consists in the string (inputed by user)
  2) of creating List, that consist only simply numbers (initial List consist random values)
  
  ## scala-lab6: "Operations on collections"
  * Needs to create functions and ScalaTests for:
  1) computing how many elements consist Listn(using foldLeft / foldRight)
  2) reverse pair of elements in List[Int]
  3) swap key and value in Map[T, U]
  
  ## scala-lab7: "Matcher. Classes"
  * Needs to use pattern matcher, ScalaTests and make:
  1) List by dividing by condition: prime – not prime to 2 and 3.
  2) 1 abstract class Notification and 3 case- classes (SMS, Emal, VoiceRecordings) and make function, that describe type of notification.
